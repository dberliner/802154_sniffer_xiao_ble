This is a port of Nordics [802154_sniffer example](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/main/samples/peripheral/802154_sniffer) for the Seeed Xiao BLE board. Nordic doen't accept changes for external boards so this is maintained on its own repo.

This example supports either the default Adafruit bootloader used for USB loading or being a standalone firmware flashed by an external debugger.
